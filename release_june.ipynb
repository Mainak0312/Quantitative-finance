    "1. Model Logic and Methodology\n",
    "These questions clarify what has changed and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Can you confirm what the logic was before this change (e.g., fixed hours/day assumption)?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why was Product.AmericanObsHoursPerDay = 7.5 (or 24 or 33.6) used before? Was that assumption justified?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 When = 0, what exact calendar-time logic is used to compute the time step? Is it based on UTC timestamps, or local market times?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Does this update affect only PDE-based barrier options, or are Monte Carlo models also impacted?\n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ 2. Implementation-Specific Checks\n",
    "These ensure the change has been coded properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Can you walk me through where the new logic is implemented? Is it in the PDE grid-building code?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 How is actual time computed — is it calendar days × 24 hrs, or actual timestamp difference (in seconds)?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Does the new method account for time zones, daylight savings, or market-specific holidays?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 How do you ensure backward compatibility? (i.e., what happens if the old setting is still used — does it throw a warning?)\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 3. Test Coverage and Evidence\n",
    "You’re checking whether the developer has tested this thoroughly.\n",

    "\n",
    "🔹 Can you share the Excel sheet and confirm how C43 links into model config?\n",

    "✅ MUST-ASK QUESTIONS (Top 8)\n",
    "🔹 1. What exactly changed in the model logic?\n",
    "➤ \"Can you clearly explain the logic used before and after setting Product.AmericanObsHoursPerDay = 0? What is the exact difference?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: You need a complete understanding of the model’s new behavior vs old behavior — is it just a parameter toggle or does it change how time steps are computed in the PDE?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. How is actual time computed?\n",
    "➤ \"When = 0, what is the exact method for computing actual calendar time? Is it timestamp difference in seconds, days, or some other method?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: Miscomputation here leads to wrong year fractions → wrong barrier probabilities → wrong price and Greeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 3. Is the time step calculated in UTC or local market time (Toronto)?\n",
    "➤ \"Is time difference computed using UTC timestamps, or is it adjusted to Toronto local time? If local, how are DST shifts handled?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: If time zones or DST are mishandled, barrier-crossing probabilities will be wrong across weekend or March/November transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 4. Are holidays and weekends treated specially?\n",
    "➤ \"Are weekends and Canadian market holidays excluded from monitoring time, or is pure calendar time used regardless?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: This affects barrier monitoring intensity — it determines how likely the barrier is to be hit over long non-trading periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 5. What tests were done to confirm the change works correctly?\n",
    "➤ \"Can you share test cases, Excel sheets, or logs that show expected vs actual time steps for known date pairs (e.g., spanning weekends)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: You must confirm the new logic gives correct results in all edge cases — e.g., weekend gaps, end-of-day timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 6. Does this change affect any other products or asset classes?\n",
    "➤ \"Is this change localized to equity PDE barrier options only, or does it affect any other models that use time stepping (e.g., MC barrier, FX, IR)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: You need to scope the impact — the setting might be used in other models by accident or design.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 7. Why is the model trigger not considered tripped?\n",
    "➤ \"Why was the model change not treated as a trigger, given that the time-step logic affects valuation and Greeks?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: You want to check if model governance is being followed correctly — they claim there's \"no live trade\", but you need proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 8. Has documentation been updated to reflect this logic?\n",
    "➤ \"Has the Model Development Document (MDD) or User Guide been updated to describe the time-stepping change and how ObsHoursPerDay=0 is handled?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why: Documentation must match model behavior — for audit, controls, and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧾 Bonus – Good to Ask If Time Permits\n",
    "Can we test this over a DST transition (e.g., March 9, 2025)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the PDE solver stable for large time steps (e.g., over long weekends)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Could this change result in unexpected P&L if someone rebooks an old trade now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do traders know how this affects their option prices near expiry or close-to-barrier?"

    "What questions as a model validator should I ask MD now? Please help me do some effective challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "Certainly — here’s how you can effectively challenge the model developer (MD) as a Model Validator, especially given the barrier option model update involving actual calendar time logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are structured, technical, and targeted at exposing risks, assumptions, and validation gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Effective Challenge Questions to Ask the Model Developer (MD)\n",
    "🔹 1. Clarify the Change Itself\n",
    "“Can you confirm the exact logic change when Product.AmericanObsHoursPerDay = 0? Specifically, how is the time step now calculated in the PDE grid?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "You must verify that the new logic actually uses real calendar time and not a hidden approximation. Push for code-level clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. Time Zone and Daylight Saving Logic\n",
    "“What time zone is used to compute the time difference — is it UTC, or local market time (e.g., Toronto)? If local, how does the model handle daylight saving time changes?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "Incorrect time zone or DST handling introduces systematic mispricing during transitions (March/November). Ask for test evidence across DST boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 3. Formula Used for Year Fraction\n",
    "“What is the exact formula used to compute the year fraction from time difference? For example, is it based on seconds or calendar days? Does it account for leap years?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "You want to uncover hidden bugs or inconsistencies in time-to-maturity calculations, which directly affect PDE stability and valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 4. Treatment of Weekends and Holidays\n",
    "“Are weekends and Canadian holidays excluded, reduced, or fully counted in time-step computation? Could this lead to sudden jumps in time step across weekends?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "You’re checking whether the model underestimates or overestimates barrier exposure over long non-trading periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 5. Numerical Stability and PDE Impact\n",
    "“Have you verified that using longer time steps (e.g., over a long weekend) does not introduce numerical instability in the PDE solution?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "When switching from uniform time steps to real calendar time, PDE solvers may become unstable or inaccurate if step sizes are inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 6. Test Coverage and Edge Case Scenarios\n",
    "**“Have you tested edge cases such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-hour barrier observation period\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations across DST switches\n",
    "\n",
    "Same-day expiry trades with only partial-day monitoring?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "For robustness, the MD should test not just normal cases, but extreme and borderline scenarios where the new time logic could break.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 7. Trigger Governance\n",
    "“Given that this change affects pricing logic, even if no live trades exist today, how do we ensure it won’t produce significant valuation differences once new trades enter the book?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "You’re challenging the assumption that “no live trades → no trigger” is always safe. You are protecting future risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 8. Transparency and Documentation\n",
    "“Has the Model Development Document (MDD), user manual, or config guide been updated to explain the new logic and this parameter’s behavior?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "Lack of documentation = risk of misuse by trading, QA, IT, and even other validators in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 9. Backward Compatibility and Control\n",
    "“What happens if Product.AmericanObsHoursPerDay is set incorrectly or inconsistently across trades? Is there a control to prevent accidental usage of 0 vs 7.5 vs 24?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "You’re ensuring defensive programming — accidental misuse of this setting should not silently affect valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 10. Impact on PV and Greeks\n",
    "“Do you have benchmark trades showing how PV, Delta, and barrier Greeks change under old vs new time logic, especially for trades near barrier or near expiry?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "This is your “so what” check — to quantify how much real-world impact this change has. Even if the trigger isn’t tripped now, this tells you how it would behave if trades existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Optional: Wrap-up Question\n",
    "“If this model logic had been in production earlier, would it have changed the outcome of any historical trades or misestimated barrier knockouts?”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why challenge?\n",
    "This is a “lookback” question to detect hidden model risk that may have already affected pricing or P&L."

    "Change 4:\n",
    "Here’s a categorized list of specific and effective challenge questions you can ask the Model Developer (MD). I’ll also explain why each question matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔷 1. Assumptions & Financial Meaning\n",
    "❓ Q1: How is the flat equivalent compounding yield calculated? Is it consistent with the cashflow structure and payoff of the bond?\n",
    "Why: You want to ensure that the equivalent yield used for MEE strike calculation reflects the bond’s payoff accurately — especially since linear accrual is non-standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q2: Why is a single flat yield appropriate to represent a linearly increasing notional? Have you tested sensitivity to choosing a time-varying equivalent rate instead?\n",
    "Why: A flat rate oversimplifies the profile of a truly accreting bond. Challenging this forces the developer to justify why this approximation is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q3: Has the linear accretion structure been benchmarked against market quotes or vendor models (e.g., Bloomberg, Markit)?\n",
    "Why: External validation is crucial for model credibility. If there's no market standard, the internal methodology must be airtight.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔷 2. Numerical & Technical Implementation\n",
    "❓ Q4: How are the equivalent compounding rates computed in the model — are they derived from time-0 growth or forward step-by-step? Why?\n",
    "Why: You've already spotted a mismatch between CAGR vs forward rates. Understanding this clarifies model assumptions and cashflow construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q5: Are interpolation methods used for MEE strike-to-rate lookup consistent across model and Excel? Linear or cubic? Are edge cases (e.g., exact 15Y vs 14.9Y) handled gracefully?\n",
    "Why: Minor differences can arise due to interpolation — but this must be controlled, especially near exercise points.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q6: How is the embedded Bermudan swaption priced — lattice, Monte Carlo, or analytical approximation? Does it correctly handle accreting notional?\n",
    "Why: Callable bonds are path-dependent due to early exercise optionality. The pricing method must support non-constant notional.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔷 3. Risk Sensitivities & Greeks\n",
    "❓ Q7: Are PV01 and Vega01 computed through bump-and-reprice? How does the model ensure smoothness in sensitivities given the step-like notional changes?\n",
    "Why: Discrete notional jumps (like in linear accrual) can cause Greek estimation instability unless properly smoothed.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q8: How does the change affect convexity and gamma of the callable bond? Were higher-order risks tested?\n",
    "Why: Optionality affects not only delta and vega, but also convexity and higher-order Greeks — which may matter for hedging.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔷 4. Portfolio-Level Impact & Controls\n",
    "❓ Q9: What threshold was used to judge “materiality” in the impact test? For instance, is a PV difference of $251k on $500M trade considered material?\n",
    "Why: It helps ensure consistent governance and materiality standards across model changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q10: Were other portfolios or exotic variants tested — e.g., cancellable swaps with linear accrual or callable structured notes?\n",
    "Why: If the update only tested a narrow use case, it may miss downstream impacts on related structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q11: Was the update regression-tested across prior production versions? Are any trades failing due to this change?\n",
    "Why: Deployment of model updates must not break legacy deals or pipeline valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔷 5. Model Governance & Documentation\n",
    "❓ Q12: Has the model update been documented in the model change log, with details of calibration, validation tests, and impact?\n",
    "Why: Governance processes require transparency and traceability of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q13: Are there limitations or disclaimers documented for this model (e.g., accuracy only valid for linear growth, annual callability only)?\n",
    "Why: If model scope is not clearly defined, it may get misused in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔶 6. Advanced Numerical Behavior\n",
    "❓ Q14: Have you tested the model for long-dated trades (e.g., 20NC1 or 30NC5)? Does the equivalent compounding rate calculation remain stable for low or high rates?\n",
    "Why: Numerical instability often creeps in for long maturities or flat rate environments (close to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q15: How does the model behave when yield is very low or negative? Does the equivalent yield still make sense?\n",
    "Why: If interest rates fall near 0% or negative, compounded vs linear growth assumptions may break down. Edge behavior must be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q16: Is the model vectorized for bulk portfolios, or does it rerun the full cashflow engine trade-by-trade? Any performance bottlenecks observed?\n",
    "Why: Even correct models can cause production issues if they are not optimized for portfolio-scale runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔶 7. Calibration and MEE Rate Surface Usage\n",
    "❓ Q17: What is the source of the MEE surface? How is it calibrated? Is it consistent with observable market prices of callable bonds or Bermudan swaptions?\n",
    "Why: If the MEE surface is outdated or miscalibrated, then even a perfectly engineered model will produce inaccurate outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q18: Does the MEE rate surface account for varying strike levels across notional profiles (e.g., non-flat, non-constant)? What are the interpolation rules?\n",
    "Why: MEE surface usage is a key driver of early exercise probability — and hence the optionality value.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q19: Is the flat equivalent compounding strike recalculated at each call date or assumed fixed from inception?\n",
    "Why: Optionality value depends on dynamic exercise logic. If strike is fixed but not recalculated, the model may under- or overstate call probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔶 8. Model Scope and Edge Case Governance\n",
    "❓ Q20: What happens if the linear growth rate is not constant (e.g., step-wise or tiered accretion)? Is this case supported or excluded?\n",
    "Why: Traders may enter exotic deal structures with non-standard growth. The model must fail gracefully or clearly document that such cases are unsupported.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q21: How does the model handle callable bonds with:\n",
    "monthly call dates instead of annual?\n",
    "\n",
    "non-standard daycount conventions (e.g., ACT/365 vs 30/360)?\n",
    "\n",
    "interrupted accrual periods (e.g., callable during deferral period)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why: Operational robustness depends on clear behavior across edge features. These arise more often than expected in structured products.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔶 9. Risk, Hedging, and P&L Explain\n",
    "❓ Q22: Is the new model compatible with risk engines and daily P&L explain tools? Can you reconcile day-over-day PV movement with changes in rates/vol?\n",
    "Why: If the new model produces values that don't reconcile under existing risk frameworks, it may disrupt daily hedging or reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q23: What is the hedge ratio behavior (DV01, Vega) under the old vs new model? Is there a significant change in risk profile?\n",
    "Why: Even if PV differences are small, the hedge behavior can change. Traders need to know if delta/vega positions must be rebalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q24: Has the model been backtested on historical trades? Are there any known discrepancies between model output and realized early calls?\n",
    "Why: Validation should ideally confirm that model output matches historical deal outcomes, especially for early exercise behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔶 10. Governance, Audit, and Communication\n",
    "❓ Q25: Has the model been independently reviewed or challenged before? Was this update signed off by Product Control / Front Office quants?\n",
    "Why: Important for regulatory documentation (e.g., SR11-7, EU model risk guidelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Q26: Is user documentation and usage guidance updated to reflect the model’s behavior, assumptions, and limitations? Has the trader community been informed?\n",
    "Why: Many model failures are usage errors — not coding errors. Good documentation avoids this.\n",

    "🔹 D. Impact Analysis & Controls\n",
    "🟩 Confirm risk and valuation changes are well-understood and justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "What thresholds were used to determine materiality in the impact test?\n",

    "\n",
    "💡 Why: You want to ensure impact was reviewed with proper standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the update affect PV01 and Vega01 at the trade level?\n",
    "Any significant changes in hedge ratios or risk profiles?\n",
